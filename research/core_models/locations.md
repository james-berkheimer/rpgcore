# Locations

Locations describe spatial or positional concepts that are mechanically relevant.

This model captures whether *where* something is matters to the rules of the game.

Locations may be concrete or abstract.

## Research questions

- Is position or location mechanically relevant?
- Is movement defined by the system?
- Is distance, adjacency, or containment important?

## Common observable features

Examples of features that may appear under this model:

- coordinates
- zones
- hexes
- grids
- ranges
- adjacency
- movement
- positioning
- terrain
- biome
- environment_effects

If a mechanic is primarily concerned with spatial relationships or positioning,
it should be categorized under Locations.

If location is purely narrative and has no mechanical impact, this model may be empty.

# Objects

Objects represent non-living items or constructs that entities can interact with.

This model captures whether a system includes mechanically meaningful items, resources, or tokens.

The model does not distinguish between physical and abstract objects.

## Research questions

- Do objects exist as mechanical concepts?
- Can entities own, carry, or use objects?
- Do objects modify entity behavior or resolution?

## Common observable features

Examples of features that may appear under this model:

- equipment
- weapons
- armor
- consumables
- currency
- resources
- charges
- damage_potential
- armor_value
- bonuses
- penalties
- durability

If a mechanic primarily describes something external to an entity that can be possessed,
consumed, or applied, it belongs in the Objects model.

Ambiguous cases should be recorded under `unknown`.
